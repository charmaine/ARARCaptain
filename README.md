You know how people get baby fever? I've been getting a serious case of cat fever. So while I was reading at my favourite coffee shop, I found myself wishing that I was holding a cat instead of a book. But I'm allergic to cats. So as of right now, this will have to do.

Here is an app that will allow you to make a cat appear on your book. Here is a screenshot of it. (I spent the whole day at the coffee shop sitting in front of my webcam while occasionally holding up a book hoping for a cat to appear. Yet, I was too shy to smile for this pic :pensive:)
